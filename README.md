This plugin gives you the ability to **add custom origins, classes or heroes**! It does this through mix and matching skills to create whatever you want! Want a skill that isn't in the plugin yet? Come and suggest it in our [discord](https://discord.gg/RCFh4Hk) or make an issue on our **[github](https://github.com/Xemorr/superheroes)**! I am very open to feedback and try to be as helpful as possible.

Do not fear if you're not the creative type though! There are 34 pre-made superheroes bundled with the plugin, all with unique abilities. Take a look!

By default, players gain a power when they log onto the server, although this can be disabled in the config.yml. There is also the option to restrict the powers they can get through this mechanic (and /hero reroll) to whichever ones they have permission for (permission format is superheroes.hero.nameofhero).

You can also give a player a hero through /hero select <heroname> <playername>

_SuperheroesPlusUltra_
SuperheroesPlusUltra is an enormous extension to the original Superheroes plugin, it enables full integration of my plugin, SkillsLibrary, into Superheroes. This means you can **write your own abilities**for heroes you design without writing any java. It also comes with three brand new default heroes to provide an example of the abilities you can create using it.

It also allows you to set **skins**for your heroes, and has **basic Skript integration**!
